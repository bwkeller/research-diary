 Today I finally finished building the tipsy generator that generates ICs from
 Oscar's disk tables.  The final derivation for the temperature from the 
 specific internal energy was as follows:
 $$T = \frac{2}{3}\frac{u\mu m_H}{k_B}$$
 The units for the specific internal energy are simply the squared velocity 
 units: $km^2/s^2$. I also assumed that the gas had the same mean molecular 
 weight as the sun, $\mu = 0.6$. This gives me a pretty reasonable looking 
 temperature profile:

 The group meeting was also very interesting today.  I'm going to work with Chris
 to produce a direct comparison of his work using SPH as a way of checking his
 work and also testing the new ionization feedback.  I need to take Chris's code
 for generating the vertical density profile, and ``stretch'' a glass to fit this
 density profile.  I'll need to talk to James, Patrick, and Chris about doing 
 this.  The final IC product will have to tile the glass cubes on top of each 
 other, and then do the stretching.  I've found a paper by Dieh et al. 
 _Generating Optimal Initial Conditions for SPH Simulations_ that seems to
 describe this process, that I will read today or tomorrow that should illuminate
 this process.
