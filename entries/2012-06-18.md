 Tuesday
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I finally got the finished, correct simple run of the disk slice. I've printed
 off a plot showing the SFR, and will show it to James tomorrow. I'm going to add
 turbulence to the ICs, and re-run them tonight. I'm going to use a turbulent 
 velocity rms equal to the average sound speed in the box (8.8 km/s)
