 I met with James today, and we discussed the results of the $10 km/s$ turbulent
 runs.  As the plots show, the crazy burst/collapse effect at the beginning was
 from the turbulent pressure: it is totally eliminated in these runs.  James
 suggest I hunt down the smaller amplituded/low $\mathbf{k}$ fluctuations:
 are they bin result? Or are they something caused reflections from the box?
