 Wednesday
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 There is a power outage in Waterloo today, so I will try and get Oscar's ICs 
 into Tipsy format today.  The ICs contain $10^6$ gas particles 
 (`N_GAS`),  $10^6$ dark matter halo particles (`N_HALO`), $10^6$
 disk star particles(`N_DISK`), $10^5$ bulge star particles 
 (`N_BULGE`).  The gas particles have mass $8.9*10^3\Msun$, the DM particles
 have mass $1.3*10^6\Msun$, and the disk star particles have mass 
 $3.6*10^4\Msun$, and the halo star particles have mass $4.5*10^5\Msun$.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Orca's downtime killed my run of g1536 with 64 neighbours, grrr`  I've written
 a little script to convert Oscar's ASCII initial condition files into tipsy
 files, and it is located at `~/Research/code/scripts/oscar_to_tipsy.py`. I
 can't yet finish it, because I have NO IDEA what units the energy is in.  I 
 believe it is actually energy/mass, but I am not quite sure.  I will need to ask
 James about this tomorrow.
