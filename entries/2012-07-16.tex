\subsection*{To Do}
\begin{bullets}
\item \checkmark Fix the Big version's initial star mass
\item \checkmark Re-run everything (turbulent) with $10km/s$ turbulence.
\item \textleaf Run with 4 glommed together versions of the IC (in the x-y plane)
\item Hunt down sources of periodicity in SFR
\item Plot energy budget in Chris' IC
\end{bullets}

\textleaf : \textit{In Progress} \qquad \checkmark : \textit{Completed}

\section*{Daily Log}
\subsection*{Monday}
I met with James today, and we discussed the results of the $10 km/s$ turbulent
runs.  As the plots show, the crazy burst/collapse effect at the beginning was
from the turbulent pressure: it is totally eliminated in these runs.  James
suggest I hunt down the smaller amplituded/low $\mathbf{k}$ fluctuations:
are they bin result? Or are they something caused reflections from the box?
