 I think the runs of the onestar boxes are done.  I'm going to produce the proper
 plots and build a page on my website for it.

 The g1536 run is going to take months.  I don't think I'm going to get much of 
 any use there.  Perhaps Rory has a completed run...

 Woah boy.  Another epic 2 hour James meeting.  I might be meeting with Samantha
 this week to offload some of the large-scale stuff to her.

 I've created ICs for Oscar's disk comparison project, and fired the low resolution 
 version up on orca.  I'll see how it looks in the morning.  Oops, forgot to add a
 softening length.  The readme says the resolution is 80 kpc, so I'll use 1/4 of 
 that to be safe.
