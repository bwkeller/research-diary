\section*{Daily Log}
\subsection*{Monday}
Watched the SHARCNet webinar.  I need to do the quiz now to get FULL ACCESS 
POWERS!  I should probably also read the tipsy documentation this week.  Quiz
was a success, I am now level 2, and can use 256 cores for a week at a time.
\subsection*{Wednesday}
I still have not received the UWash password.  Not much to do without that.
