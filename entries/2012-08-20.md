 Daily Log
 ================================================================================
 
 Monday
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Today I built a fancy new version of Mikhail's log tool.  I've called the new 
 version lanyon, after Dr. Jekyll's skeptical colleague.  I used the name since
 Hyde is the project that inspired the change.

 Tuesday
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Woefully unproductive today.  After the disappointment of trying to debug MAGICC
 gasoline, I am utterly sapped of motivation.  Essentially all I did was update
 the log system to use my new lanyon toolkit

 Wednesday
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Today, I met briefly with James.  We discussed the meeting he just attended,
 and some things that I should get done.  I've restarted the Chris IC runs with
 `DRTFORCE` and the Chabrier IMF, and the MAGICC runs without the troublesome
 `MORE_METALS`.  Hopefully the fuckers will actually run now.

 Thursday
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I've started to re-run the onestar runs with the properties James suggested
 (star particle with 1/3 the mass of the gas particle), and also re-wrote the
 plotting scripts to not subtract the zero energy.  I ought to add a section for
 my research page describing this.

 I've downloaded the data to start creating the Disk IC from Oscar.  I will need
 to figure out how to add the pressure floor, what that floor ought to be, and
 the parameter options to run isothermally.  Also, I ought to find out the
 metallicity I should add.  Awesome, gasoline has a parameter `dMeanMolWeight`
 that lets me put that straight in.
