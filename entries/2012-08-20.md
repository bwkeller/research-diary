 Daily Log
 ================================================================================
 
 Monday
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Today I built a fancy new version of Mikhail's log tool.  I've called the new 
 version lanyon, after Dr. Jekyll's skeptical colleague.  I used the name since
 Hyde is the project that inspired the change.

 Tuesday
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Woefully unproductive today.  After the disappointment of trying to debug MAGICC
 gasoline, I am utterly sapped of motivation.  Essentially all I did was update
 the log system to use my new lanyon toolkit

 Wednesday
