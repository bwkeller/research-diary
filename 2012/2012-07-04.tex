\subsection*{To Do}
\begin{bullets}
\item Get phase diagram for ionization run at $\approx 100$ Myr
\item \textleaf Re-run EVERYTHING without divv, and with proper initial star masses
\item \textleaf Run with ionization, no SN
\item Run with 4 glommed together versions of the IC (in the x-y plane)
\end{bullets}

\textleaf : \textit{In Progress} \qquad \checkmark : \textit{Completed}

\section*{Daily Log}
\subsection*{Wednesday}
Met with James today.  We discussed many things.  Apparently, it is accepted 
practice (read tradition) to build stars in the following way:  2 stars are 
made from from each gas particle, each with a mass of 0.3 the initial gas 
particle, leaving 0.4 of the gas remaining.  Feedback and accretion happens, 
and gas particles below 0.1 get deleted (I assume that means they get accreted
on to the star particles?)
