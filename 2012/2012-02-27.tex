\section*{Daily Log}
\subsection*{Wednesday}
There is a power outage in Waterloo today, so I will try and get Oscar's ICs 
into Tipsy format today.  The ICs contain $10^6$ gas particles 
(\verb!N_GAS!),  $10^6$ dark matter halo particles (\verb!N_HALO!), $10^6$
disk star particles(\verb!N_DISK!), $10^5$ bulge star particles 
(\verb!N_BULGE!).  The gas particles have mass $8.9*10^3\Msun$, the DM particles
have mass $1.3*10^6\Msun$, and the disk star particles have mass 
$3.6*10^4\Msun$, and the halo star particles have mass $4.5*10^5\Msun$.
\subsection*{Thursday}
Orca's downtime killed my run of g1536 with 64 neighbours, grrr!  I've written
a little script to convert Oscar's ASCII initial condition files into tipsy
files, and it is located at \verb!~/Research/code/scripts/oscar_to_tipsy.py!. I
can't yet finish it, because I have NO IDEA what units the energy is in.  I 
believe it is actually energy/mass, but I am not quite sure.  I will need to ask
James about this tomorrow.
