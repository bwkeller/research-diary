\section{Daily Log}

\subsection{Wednesday}

There is a power outage in Waterloo today, so I will try and get Oscar's
ICs into Tipsy format today. The ICs contain $10^6$ gas particles
(\texttt{N\_GAS}), $10^6$ dark matter halo particles (\texttt{N\_HALO}),
$10^6$ disk star particles(\texttt{N\_DISK}), $10^5$ bulge star
particles (\texttt{N\_BULGE}). The gas particles have mass
$8.9*10^3\Msun$, the DM particles have mass $1.3*10^6\Msun$, and the
disk star particles have mass $3.6*10^4\Msun$, and the halo star
particles have mass $4.5*10^5\Msun$.

\subsection{Thursday}

Orca's downtime killed my run of g1536 with 64 neighbours,
grrr\texttt{I've written a little script to convert Oscar's ASCII initial condition files into tipsy files, and it is located at}\textasciitilde{}/Research/code/scripts/oscar\_to\_tipsy.py`.
I can't yet finish it, because I have NO IDEA what units the energy is
in. I believe it is actually energy/mass, but I am not quite sure. I
will need to ask James about this tomorrow.
