\section{Daily Log}

\subsection{Friday}

All right, today I'm going to get some real work done. I've got the
afternoon free, so I'll try and kill off some of my tasks. I got my
login info from Uwash, but they still haven't given me the git
repository information, so I'm going to try and catch up with my arXiv
backlog as much as possible today.\\I tried hunting down the git
repository, no luck though, gah! I've progressed pretty far through the
arXiv backlog, but boy is it ever deep! I should mention SAO 206462
today in the group meeting today, Patrick may be interested in direct
observation of stellar spiral arm structure. I found the web page for
tipsy, it is at
http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/tipsy/tipsy.html . I can read
this to get up to date with the tipsy tool. If I don't get my login by
next week, I'm emailing Tom to ask about it.
