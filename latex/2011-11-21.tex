\section{Daily Log}

\subsection{Thursday}

I was finally able to get ChaNGa to run Tom's ICs today. I had to
install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), and do some modifications to
the Makefile generated by configure in order to get it to successfully
use all of the configuration options in \verb!Disk_Collapse_1e6.param!.
I ran configure with the option
\verb!./configure --enable-cooling=cosmo! and added the following to the
final generated Makefile:\textbackslash{} Added @ Line 11:
\verb!BEN = -DDIFFUSION!\textbackslash{} Appended to the end of Line 62:
\verb!$(BEN)! (Line 62 reads \verb!DEFINE_FLAGS = ...!)\textbackslash{}
After compiling with these options (NOTE: \verb!make clean! can be ran
to obliterate old compiled versions), Tom's ICs totally run. I spent
hours trying to get ChaNGa to run on a SHARCNet machine (requin, saw,
and orca) unsuccesfully this evening, and decided to run the ICs on
angband, which should complete the run this weekend. ChaNGa has a bunch
of output, which I will need to analyze and document. I will also need
to more thouroughly attempt a SHARCNet run of ChaNGa, and document what
does and does not work. I will need to use requin, as it is the only
machine that includes the latest (6.3.1) version of Charm++.

\subsection{Friday}

I started to run ChaNGa on angband last night, and it is running
smoothly this morning. A back of the envelope calculation estimates it
should complete in the morning tomorrow. I will have to look into
compiling it with CUDA support, and see if that is very fast on angband.
It would please me greatly to be able to compete with requin for speed
with my own personal machine!\textbackslash{} Today I am trying to get
gasoline to run Tom's ICs. I've downloaded all of the \verb!pkdgrav!
directory from \verb!imp:/home/wadsley/pkdgrav/!, so I will now try and
pick through it to find what is the most current version of gasoline.
